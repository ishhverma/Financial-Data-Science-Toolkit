## ðŸ“ˆ Global Macro Forecasting: ML, Econometrics, and Real-Time Data

Explore my advanced [Global_Macro_Forecasting_ML,_Econometrics,_and_Real_Time_Data.ipynb](./Global_Macro_Forecasting_ML,_Econometrics,_and_Real_Time_Data.ipynb) notebook, which demonstrates state-of-the-art techniques in global macroeconomic forecasting. This end-to-end workflow leverages cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and rigorous econometric models to analyze and predict macroeconomic indicators using real-time data.

**Key Features:**
- **Comprehensive Data Pipeline:** Automated acquisition and preprocessing of macroeconomic and financial time series from multiple real-time sources.
- **Hybrid Modeling Approach:** Integrates machine learning (Random Forests, XGBoost, LSTM) and classical econometric techniques (VAR, ARIMA) for robust forecasting.
- **Feature Engineering & Selection:** Implements advanced feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and economic intuition for predictor construction.
- **Model Evaluation & Explainability:** Employs cross-validation, out-of-sample testing, and interpretable AI tools (e.g., SHAP) for transparent insights.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Dynamic charts and dashboards for scenario analysis and performance diagnostics.

> **Result:** The notebook delivers actionable macroeconomic forecasts and risk signals, supporting data-driven investment and policy decisions.
