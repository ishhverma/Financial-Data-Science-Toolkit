## ðŸ“‚ Code Summary

This repository features advanced financial data science projects with a focus on:

- **Credit Risk Prediction:** Demonstrates risk modeling techniques using machine learning.
- **Portfolio Optimization:** Implements quantitative strategies for optimal asset allocation.
- **Macroeconomic Analysis:** Leverages econometric models and real-time data for forecasting.

The main code is organized as a Jupyter Notebook:

- [`Global_Macro_Forecasting_ML,_Econometrics,_and_Real_Time_Data.ipynb`](https://github.com/ishhverma/Financial-Data-Science-Toolkit/blob/main/Global_Macro_Forecasting_ML,_Econometrics,_and_Real_Time_Data.ipynb):  
  This notebook integrates machine learning (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), advanced feature engineering, time series modeling, and model explainability (using SHAP and related tools) for comprehensive financial analysis.

Key skills highlighted include data preprocessing, feature engineering, time series analysis, risk management, and the application of state-of-the-art modeling and explainability tools.
